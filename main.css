My Udacity Experience

Challenging, thrilling, draining but very rewarding.
Met with bright minds and loving people.
A good place to network with other techies.
The projects are very detailed.
The class notes very explicit and courses were taught with the use of video.
The career sessions were also detailed.
In addition, there is a very fast response time to issues.
